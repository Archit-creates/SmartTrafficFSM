# SmartTrafficFSM
SmartTrafficFSM is a Finite State Machine (FSM) implemented in Verilog (or VHDL) to control a standard 3-light traffic signal system. It manages the sequence of green, yellow, and red lights for a two-way intersection (e.g., North-South and East-West), optimizing traffic flow and ensuring safety.
